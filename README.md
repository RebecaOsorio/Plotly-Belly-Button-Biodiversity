# Plotly Belly Button Biodiversity
A biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory is interested in bacterial species that have ability to synthesize that taste like beef, and the had partnered with Improbable Beef; a food startups.

Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots.

However, Improbable Beef is still searching for the elusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste and Roza, the biological researcher, has a hypothesis that there's a microorganism that can supply the best taste, and she believes it can be found in the bacteria found on the belly button of a human body.

To test her hypothesis, Roza has sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our buttons. Each person has an ID number, to protect their identities.

Now, she presents a dashboard in which the patients will be able to visit a website and select their ID numbers to see which bacterial species live in their navels.


For this Challenge, we completed the page that we were working on during the Module.
We started with this:

![Starter Page](https://github.com/RebecaOsorio/Plotly-Belly-Button-Biodiversity/blob/main/image%20src/start_page.png)

to turn it into this:

![Final Page](https://github.com/RebecaOsorio/Plotly-Belly-Button-Biodiversity/blob/main/image%20src/final_page.png)

### Resources

To accomplish this project, we used:

-   **Data Source:**  [`samples.json` ](https://github.com/RebecaOsorio/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js) file, research generously funded by Improbable Beef
    
-   **Software:**  
	- **VS Code** 1.64.2(user setup)-_as our code interpreter_. We will also use basic **HTML** , **Bootstrap** and **CSS** to build and style the entire page. 
	- **JavaScript** version VS6+ to populate and dynamically filter a table.
	- **Plotly** *last version* to draw the plots shown in the page. 

## Overview of the Analysis

### Bubble Chart
We worked to display the Bacteria Cultures found in each Test Subject so the X-axis is the UTO Layout, and the amount of samples of the bacterial culture found in the belly button is represented in the Y-axis as in the size of the bubble. This way, the distribution of the samples found in the human body is easy to read.

### Bar Chart
This chart shows the Top Ten biggest Bacterial Cultures found in the dataset, filtered for the Subject

### Gauge Chart
Roza found interesting to add a chart that shows how many times did the patient said he washed its bellybutton per week
